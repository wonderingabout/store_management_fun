# Managing lists in C++

A quick command-line tool i coded in C++ for fun!!

## Personal Purposes

Allowed me to learn about vectors and practice C++ :)

I have a lot of ideas of how i could improve it, for example adding a checkIsNumber
on user's price or quantity input, or add a "cancel" check at every command, not just
the main ones.

But this program achieved its purpose, which was to get familiar with C++ programming,
coming from a Javascript background.

## Support

Uses standard libraries only, so is cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.)

## Instructions

On linux:

While in main.cpp's directory

```C++
g++ -o main main.cpp && ./main
```
